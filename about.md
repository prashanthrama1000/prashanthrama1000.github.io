### Bio

Hey! I'm Prashanth working as a Software Engineer III at Walmart Global Tech India. I've over 4 years of experience in developing highly scalable distributed systems using Java, Spring etc. and responsive UI pages using JavaScript (ES6), HTML and CSS.

I do believe that an answer to a problem whether in work or in life, is not just any solution but the most optimal solution.

My expertise includes:

- Java is a really powerful language from the perspective of a back-end developer. My expertise in Java includes the core concepts and enterprise frameworks such as Spring and Jersey for building RESTful applications, JPAs including EclipseLink and Hibernate for persistent database operations. Jackson for serialization.
